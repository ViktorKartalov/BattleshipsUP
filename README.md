This is a simple Battleships game, created for the Introduction to Programming Practicum course at FMI.

Description:
This is a clone of the classic battleships game, in which you and your opponent hide ships on a grid and try to find each other's ships.
There are two gamemodes in my game, a one player and two player mode.
Both start off with the player/s choosing dimensions for the playing field, as well as how many of each length of ship can be used in the game.
In one player mode the player faces off against a computer opponent, and two player mode is a local multiplayer mode in which two players on the same device take turns looking for each other's ships.
If you close the game during gameplay, it gets saved automatically and you can resume it the next time you open the application.
